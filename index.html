				 <p>Happy 15th birthday, Piyal💝 </p>
<p>This is the exact moment you turned 15.</p>
<p> It's 12:00 am, 25th of May, 2024.</p>
<p> I don't know when you are reading this message,</p>
<p> but it was sent exactly at 12:00.</p>
<p>Happy birthday again! 🍼</p>

<p>And not only it's your birthday,</p>
<p>but also it's a day to look back at all your memories</p>
<p> that you had for 15 years of this life.</p>
<p> You're 15 years old now, </p>
<p>which is about 131400 hours,</p>
<p> and it may vary depending on the time of your birth,</p>
<p> which I do not know because</p>
<p> you didn't show me your birth certificate 😡.</p>

<p>In minutes if you count,</p>
<p> it's 7884000 minutes,</p>
<p>and by the time you're reading this message, it's 7884001</p>
<p> and counting.....</p>
<p>In seconds it will be, 473040000,</p>
<p>and it changed,</p>
<p> again changed,</p>
<p> and yes, again changed, haha.</p>

<p>Anyways,</p>
<p> if you look back in time you might not remember how you were born in the hospital, hehe.</p>
<p>You might not remember those nurses</p>
<p>who held you in hands,</p>
<p> you might not remember the smile on the face of your dad and mom.</p>
<p> They are the persons in this whole world who love you the most,</p>
<p>did you understand me 😡, </p>
<p>doesn't matter if your boyfriend says he loves you the most,</p>
<p> he's still on the 3rd rank 😡.</p>

<p>I'm kidding,</p>
<p>but you don't have a boyfriend,</p>
<p>or maybe you have idk.</p>
<p>But do you remember those things when you were born?</p>

<p>I know you're thinking that,</p>
<p> "how will I remember I was just a baby!"</p>
<p> Well, you can imagine it,</p>
<p> it's like virtual reality, but in your head. </p>
<p>And yes, you thought it right, "you were just a baby" </p>
<p>and still just a baby🍼.</p>

<p>I don't know whether this message is being read first or last</p>
<p> because you have so many friends,</p>
<p> it's okay if you are not reading it first.</p>
<p> But let me tell you, it was sent exactly at 12:00</p>
<p> with the help of automation.</p>
<p> I've started writing this message on 10th May,</p>
<p> and I'll write daily something new</p>
<p> and it will be sent to you all together, </p>
<p>which is already sent and you are reading it now😉.</p>

<p>But, I forgot to tell you one thing,</p>
<p> do you remember your first birthday celebration from your memory?</p>
<p> I mean can you recall it?</p>
<p> If you can then congratulations, you'll never forget it</p> <p>because, normally you would forget it by the age of 20-25,</p>
<p> but here's me😎😎</p>
<p> I reminded you about it on your 15th birthday,</p>
<p>so there's a small possibility of forgetting that,</p>
<p> I hope you remember it your whole life.</p>

<p>Piyal, I had an idea to wish you exactly at 12:00 in your room</p>
<p>, from your window if you have any. </p>
<p>But then I realized it will be a bad idea</p>
<p>because I don't have any knowledge about your home</p>
<p> and I won't go online to ask you about your home.</p>
<p> Idk you may feel that I'm really a kidnapper haha.</p>
<p> I would literally do it if you lived near me.</p>
<p> I would do for sure.</p>

<p>😊😊</p>

<p>Piyal, on this special day,</p>
<p> although it's night.</p>
<p> Okay then.</p>
<p> On this special night, or maybe day!</p>
<p> Idk.. anyways,</p>
<p> I want you to think of the names of 3 persons</p>
<p>whom you love the most.</p>
<p> In 10 seconds.</p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>4</p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p>6</p>
<p> 7 </p>
<p>8</p> 
<p>9 </p>
<p>10 </p>
<p>You thought of them?</p>

<p> Okay good now, listen to this story.</p>

<p>So, there was lived a king long time ago in Germany,</p>
<p>his name was Nitzchergchery Géfrztexilnson 🇩🇪, </p>
<p>and he was a good poet,</p>
<p> he used to write stories, and poems.</p>
<p> But wait a minute 🧐,</p>
<p> did you just ignore his name,</p>
<p>okay!</p>
<p> Because you ignored his name, </p>
<p>I'll not tell you the whole story 🤪.</p>

<p>Okay now, </p>
<p>what I was about to say was, those three names...</p>
<p>whom you love the most.</p>
<p> I don't care who are they</p>
 <p>because you again forgot to choose yourself</p>
<p> in those 3 people 🥺.</p>
<p> Why!!!🥺🥺</p>
<p> Love yourself, embrace yourself, Piyal.</p>
<p> You are beautiful, kind, generous, and a berry good girl.</p>

<p>I never write paragraphs,</p>
<p>well, I used to write many years ago but not now.</p>
<p>I'm writing it this much long because it's your birthday 😡🍼. </p>
<p>I can write long long long paragraphs for you, but that will make things different.</p>

<p>Idk how long this message will be,</p>
<p>but it will be interesting I guess.</p>
<p> I may not exist next year to wish you</p>
<p> again in the same way, </p>
<p>or maybe a more unexpected and cooler</p>
 <p>Or some –98°C cool way.</p>
<p> I have an idea.</p>
<p> I'll not tell it to you but if I'm alive till next year,</p>
<p> you'll see it by yourself.</p>

<p>🤫🥰🐺</p>

<p>And yes, happy birthday again and again and again 🍼.</p>
<p> I'm happy for you.</p>
<p>You turned 15, you gay me also gay. </p>
<p>Your heart has beaten 315,360,000 💓 times in 15 years,</p>
<p> and by the time you're reading this message,</p>
<p>it has increased by a couple more hundred times📈.</p>
<p> In those 15 years, your heart has felt different feelings,</p>
<p> sorrow, grief, joy, regret, happiness</p>
<p>but still working fine.</p>
<p> Its still beating even though you faced problems,</p>
<p>and got pain </p>
<p>which you didn't reveal to anyone. </p>
<p>It healed by itself. </p>
<p>It still works.</p>
<p> I love it, how it works 24*7 non stop.</p>

<p>I don't know how to give compliments,</p>
<p>I just say good, </p>
<p>and you are good. </p>
<p>I don't know I'm your "special" or "some ordinary" friend.</p>
<p> But I definitely know that, </p>
<p>in my point of view, you are my friend</p>
<p> and I have few friends, less than 5,</p>
<p>and you are one of them</p>
<p> and you are awesome and special.</p>

<p>Im sorry if I said anything unwanted haha.</p>
<p>You know I'm not a mind reader but,</p>
<p> I can assure you that</p>
<p> you are reading this message in your mind</p>
<p>but, in my voice.👀</p>

<p>😁😁😁</p>

<p>I will be offline, Piyal.</p>
 <p>I have to do things which are not done yet</p>
<p> and I have to make it happen.</p> 
<p>You maybe know me as a hacker,</p>
<p> or someone who likes technology and computers.</p>
<p> But I learned all this during last 2-3 months.</p>
<p> Im not stable, I don't stay at one place. </p>
<p>There are different personalities inside me.</p>
<p> Whatever life has to offer I'll do it.</p>
<p> I have so many skills, in different aspects of life. </p>
<p> but still, I thrive to achieve more.</p>

<p>It's been 16 days since I went offline,</p>
<p> you probably forgot about me, </p>
<p>neither you thought about me after it crossed 10 days</p>
<p> (maybe, I'm assuming). </p>
<p>I thought about you and wrote this message for 16 days.💌</p> 
<p>Although it's not quite good enough.</p>
<p>You probably forgot about me. </p>
<p>But this message which you are reading right now</p>
<p> will remind you of me.</p>
<p> But again after some days,</p>
<p> when I'll be inactive again, </p>
<p>you'll forget about me</p>
<p> and your life will go on. And that's totally fine.</p>
<p> You must continue your life ahead.</p>

<p>I just wanted you to say that you are a good person.</p>
<p> I'll never forget you. </p>
<p>As I told, I've different personalities,</p>
<p> you added one to it.</p>
<p>🥰 "Pookie bear dinosaur",</p>
<p> I was never so friendly like this.</p>
<p> You were right, I'm rude. </p>
<p>I'm rude because I don't like new people,</p>
<p> I don't want new friends. </p>
<p>But still idk how you became my friend.</p>
<p> Anyways thank you my dear</p>
<p>☺️☺️</p>
<p>You are just a baby. 🍼🥺</p>
<p>When you grow up,</p>
<p> I wish you see the world as I see.</p>
<p> Through my eyes. </p>
<p>I will pray, for you to get the same vision.</p>
<p> Believe me, it's great.</p>
<p> I know you are chasmish🤪🥸 </p>
<p>but I didn't mean that vision, </p>
<p>I meant, another vision.</p>
<p> Idk whether you are understanding my words or not.</p>
<p> Just understand this much :)</p> 
<p>"Happy Birthday day, Piyal,</p>
<p> many many happy returns of the day, </p>
<p>I'll not call you Aish anymore. </p>
<p>Your parents named you with ample love and care, </p>
<p>you told me your name is weird!!</p>
<p>It's not weird, it's beautiful </p>
<p>Piyal means 'LOVING'💖,</p>
<p> I'll call you Piyal from now,☺️</p>
<p>If ever I come online.😅</p>
<p>🫂</p>
<p>I'm sorry, something happened to me</p>
<p>and let me tell you I don't hide anything.</p>
 <p>That day I told you directly that I'm so obsessed with you,</p> 
<p>it's true, I was getting obsessed with you.</p>
 <p>So obsessed.</p>
 <p>But I controlled myself and I shall distance myself from you.</p>
<p> Don't think this is the reason for my inactivity.</p>
<p> I thought it would be better if I distance myself from you.</p>

<p>I'm not a good person.</p>
<p>Forgive me.</p>

<p>Happy birthday💖</p>
<p> Bye.</p> 
<p> I will miss you.</p>
